We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.

**WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING** from home a few days of the week or full-time, it's important to carve out a space that separates your work and personal life. It's equally important to make sure your work station is fully kitted out with the right gear and accessories to make the day more bearable and comfortable. Since 2020, we've been testing standing desks, office chairs, monitors, USB docks, keyboards, and tons of other work-from-home gear in our own lives—these are our favorites.

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;2Fifty Texas BBQ (Multiple locations)

For D.C. residents, sampling the most tantalizing brisket inside the Beltway requires a drive into Riverdale Park, Maryland. Fernando González and Debby Portillo, the couple that own and operate 2Fifty, pay homage to Central Texas by using oak smoke to develop a dark bark on fatty hunks of prime and American wagyu beef that jiggle on the chopping block. Beef ribs, pulled pork, sliced turkey, and St. Louis-style ribs are all available, too. Daily specials like brisket tacos and barbecue pupusas give the kitchen a creative outlet. Sides such as red kidney beans braised with brisket, caramelized pineapple, and coleslaw interspersed with raisins nod to the owners’ Salvadoran heritage. Diners can preorder for pickup Wednesday through Sunday with the option to dine there or take it to go. In June, 2Fifty expanded into D.C. with a small stall inside Union Market.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Muchas Graciass

Chef Christian Irabién started this Mexican pop-up in Upper Northwest to support relief efforts for refugee chefs and hungry hospitality workers. Now a permanent fixture, Muchas Gracias has amassed a steady following for its lunchtime burritos, full of braised short ribs or charred sweet potatoes, that pay homage to the filling lunches he ate growing up in Northern Mexico and West Texas. A dinner menu offers a mix of snacks like queso fundido with mezcal-flambéed Chihuahua cheese, seasonal specials like ramp enchiladas verdes, taco platters, and a standout tres leches cake covered in flowers and berries. Call or email to reserve outdoor tables positioned in the front and back.
